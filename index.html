            As

            at his high school newspaper Collin managed an editorial staff of eight.

            A television ad agency employed Collin as a video technician in a
            <em>self-organizing</em>
            department with
            <em>strenuous workloads</em>
            and
            <em>strict deadlines.</em>
            Collin made use of his precious free time learning from the video editors. Then he took over simple tasks freeing the
            editors to focus on more valuable work.  In six months Collin
            <em>aggressively &ldquo;promoted&rdquo; himself</em>
            to editing videos the CEO used in
            <em>industry-wide presentations.</em>

            Through his
            <em>passion</em>
            for improvised acting Collin has performed for audiences in excess of four hundred,  keeping them laughing all the way.  Improvising coherent scenes requires
            <em>excellent team-working</em>
            skills and
            <em>&ldquo;on your feet&rdquo; thinking.</em>
            In Improv, much like the rest of life, giving your team mates something to do and
            <em>making them look great</em>
            in the process reigns paramount.
            Most recently Collin has taken classes at
            <a href='http://newyork.ucbtheatre.com/'>http://newyork.ucbtheatre.com/.</a>

            Disappointed by the opportunities in the public school system Collin
            <em>took control of his curriculum.</em>
            As a &ldquo;part-time&rdquo; student Collin&rsquo;s studies were interest driven. In his twelfth year Collin began an internship which turned into a full-time position. Collin
            <em>entered the workforce as his peers finished out their Senior year.</em>
